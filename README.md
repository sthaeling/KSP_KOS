# Kerbal Space Program

Kerbal Space Program is a science based educational physics simulation, in which the player's task is to make his colony of Kerbals become an interplanetary species.
Or to go to the mun. Or to just make a teapot and launch it into space. Really, you can do whatever you like, it's a whole star system waiting to be explored by your kerbonauts.

Wether you build colonies on other planets or moons, or you just like to build your own planes or rovers, your Kerbals are bored, so do something about it.

# Technology

These scripts are written in Kerbal OS' own scripting language called "kerboscript".

The very simple syntax allows even unexperienced programmers to develop in a fun environment.

"kOS is to programming, what Kerbal Space Program itself is to rocket science." - https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/index.html

# Documentation
